      Confirm Classification File Import Dialog 
   </H3>

   <P>
      This <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Confirm classification file import</SPAN> 
      dialog appears between the moment that you select a file to 
      
         import classification data from, and the moment that the file is 
      read from disk as the import continues. This way you can choose a file and 
      then monitor it until you see that it is being updated by for instance a 
      photo finish operator, so that you can import the most recent data.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   
<P> <IMG src="../screenshots/screen87.gif" width="426" height="315" ALT="Confirm classification file import dialog"><P CLASS="caption">Confirm classification file import dialog</P></P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      The dialog shows the chosen file's name as well as its file time in order 
      to decide whether the most recent version is available already. As a reference 
      the current system time is shown.</P>

   <P>
      Note that the system time is taken from your local computer, while the file's 
      time might depend on an other computer in your network, if that is where 
      you are importing the file from.</P>

   <P>
         As soon as the file satisfies your expectations, you use the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Proceed</SPAN> 
         button. <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Cancel</SPAN> terminates the import 
         altogether.</P>

   <P>
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Proceed on change of file time</SPAN><I> </I> 
         will have StageRace proceed automatically on the very first occurring 
         change in the file time.</P>

   <P>
      The appearance of this dialog can be switched off entirely through the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Options</SPAN> dialog.</P>
