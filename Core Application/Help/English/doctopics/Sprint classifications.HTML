      Sprint Classifications 
   </H4>

   <P>
      For every 
      
         half stage you can set up a scheme of points for the sprint classification.</P>

   <P>
      Sprint points are awarded:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>For the best riders in any intermediate sprints; and</LI><LI>Optionally 
      for the best riders in the stage arrival.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      The sum of these points from every 
      
         half stage will be used to calculate a general individual sprint 
      classification from. For a competitor to appear in the sprint classification, 
      he/she must successfully complete the 
      
         half stage.</P>

   <P>
      For sprint classifications a separate publication is generated, which lists 
      all the intermediate sprint results as well as the general sprint classification. 
   </P>

   <H5>
      Configuration 
   </H5>

   <P>
      The configuration of sprint points will be done by use of the tab sheet 
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Sprint classification</SPAN> of the 
      
         configuration of the particular half stage. This can be found through 
      <SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> Configure selection...</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configuration</SPAN> 
      menu, when the appropriate 
      
         half stage is selected in the 
      
         event tree.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   
<P> <IMG src="../screenshots/screen19.gif" width="422" height="411" ALT="Configuration of a sprint classification"><P CLASS="caption">Configuration of a sprint classification</P></P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      On the tab sheet there are two lists: <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Interm.</SPAN> 
      and <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Finish</SPAN> to enter the sprint points for 
      the intermediate sprints and the stage arrival respectively. The sprint 
      points in these lists correspond to the successive rankings, starting from 
      1.</P>

   <H6>
      Add 
   </H6>

   <P>
      To add sprint points, the number of points has to be entered in the field 
      above the particular list and <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Add</SPAN> has to 
      be clicked.</P>

   <P>
      There is no real limit to the amount of sprint points that you can enter.</P>

   <H6>
      Remove 
   </H6>

   <P>
      If a sprint points entry is selected from a list, it can be deleted by clicking 
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Remove</SPAN>.</P>

   <H6>
      Number of Sprints 
   </H6>

   <P>
      Also the number of sprints has to be entered. This is including the finish.</P>

   <P>
      Thus, for three intermediate sprints, for instance, a number of 4 should 
      be entered here.</P>

   <P>
      By entering 1 there will only sprint points be assigned during the stage 
      arrival; intermediate sprint points as entered will be ignored.</P>

   <P>
      By entering 0 no bonuses at all will be assigned; points as entered will 
      be ignored. The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Sprint classification</SPAN> item 
      will subsequently be removed from the 
      
         event tree.</P>

   <P>
      If you only want sprint points to be assigned to intermediate sprints and 
      not to the stage arrival, you enter no points in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Finish</SPAN> 
      list. However, you nevertheless have to count the stage arrival for the 
      number of sprints that you enter. This is a very conceivable situation, 
      since sprint classifications very often are only about intermediate sprints, 
      making the classification independent from the actual stage arrival.</P>

   <P>
      StageRace allows to enter up to 25 sprints, which should be amply sufficient.</P>
