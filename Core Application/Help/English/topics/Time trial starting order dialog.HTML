      Time Trial Starting Order Dialog 
   </H1>

      <P>
         This tab sheet consists of two lists: <EM>available</EM> and <EM>classified</EM> 
         competitors. The list of available competitors consists of all competitors 
         who were not 
         <A HREF="Sign%20outs.html">
            signed out</A> neither dropped out at the start of the particular 
         stage. That is also why this starting order can only be drawn up after 
         the previous stage has finished.</P>

      <P>
         If this is a half stage higher than 1 within a certain stage, and the 
         previous half stage has not yet been ridden (i.e. no competitors exist 
         in the previous half stage's arrival dialog) the arrived competitors 
         from the previous full stage are shown here as available and can be used 
         to set up an order. The competitors however, will not show up for ranking 
         in this half stage until finished in the previous half stage (that was 
         empty while setting up the starting order).</P>

   
<P> When competitors are already classified in the time trial to which a starting 
  list applies, these competitors are marked in the list with an asterisk in the 
  <span class="screenquote">Ranked</span> column. Depending on <a href="Half%20stages.html">half 
  stage settings</a>, their starting time can or cannot be altered anymore. If 
  these &quot;late changes&quot; are allowed, you can even alter the starting 
  time, after the competitor has finished for the time trial.</P>

   <P>
      Competitors can move from the <EM>available</EM> list to the <EM>classified</EM> 
      list by entering their start no., starting order and starting time. When 
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Submit</SPAN> is clicked, the data is submitted 
      and the competitor moves.</P>

   <P>
      You can also select one or multiple competitors in the <EM>classified</EM> 
      list, change their starting times and click <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Submit</SPAN> 
      again to apply the entered starting time to the entire selection.</P>

   <H2>
      Declass. 
   </H2>

   <P>
      When you select one or multiple competitors in the <EM>classified</EM> list, 
      and you click <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Declass.</SPAN>, the competitors 
      are moved back to the <EM>available</EM> list.</P>

   <P>
      Note:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI> As soon as a rider is classified, automatically the starting order 
      field will be incremented. So when you are entering successively ordered 
      competitors, you only need to enter the start nos. and possibly time (after 
      the first competitor has been entered);</LI><LI>When a rider is clicked 
      in either one of the two lists, its data will be copied into the edit boxes 
      in order to edit it quickly;</LI><LI>A large number of competitors can be 
      entered easily by one hand only, using the numeric keypad of the keyboard;</LI><LI>Pressing 
      the Enter key has the same result as clicking the <span class="screenquote">Submit</span> 
      button; and</LI><LI>Multiple riders from the <EM>classified</EM> list can 
      be selected (while holding down either the Shift or the Ctrl key). All selected 
      riders can be declassed simultaneously. Also all selected riders can be 
      given a new starting time at the same moment. </LI>

    Fill this dialog on basis of a previous half stage's classification. Depending 
    on which half stage this time trial starting order dialog is actually for, 
    you can choose the last half stage before this half stage or the last half 
    stage from the previous full stage. The lowest ranked competitor is always 
    placed further down, so that the worst ranked competitor starts first in the 
    time trial. In the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Automatic from earlier stage</SPAN> 
    dialog that appears: 
    <UL>

    After automatically generating a time trial starting order with the <span class="screenquote">Avoid

    consecutive members are at a particular end of the order list; it is by design, 
    because it's not covered by any regulations, and it is up to the race organiser
