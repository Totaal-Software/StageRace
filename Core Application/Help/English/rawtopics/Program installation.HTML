   <P>
      The installation file will unpack itself and start the actual installation 
      wizard. Step through this installation wizard using the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Next</SPAN> 
      button.</P>

      When you install StageRace on Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> XP, the file <span class="screenquote">StageRace.exe.manifest</span> 
      will arrange for StageRace to make use of the theme that is selected in 
      your Windows<sup>&reg;</sup>. This file is by standard part of the installation.</P>

   <P>
         By use of <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Add or remove components</SPAN> in

         the computer system entirely, except for hardware key device drivers.</P>
