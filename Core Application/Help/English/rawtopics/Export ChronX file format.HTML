      Export Competitors for AMB ChronX 
   </H1>

   <P>
      Competitors can be exported from StageRace so they can be used in AMB ChronX. 
   </P>

   <P>
      Note that you can also import ChronX files for 
      <A HREF="Arrival%20dialog.html">
         ranking a stage</A>. </P>

   <H2>
      Introduction 
   </H2>

   <P>
      AMB i.t. specializes in the design, manufacturing and support of sports 
      timing and scoring systems.</P>

   <P>
      Their Cyclip system is specifically designed for the identification and 
      timing during cycling events. For an unlimited number of competitors it 
      is possible to give positions, best lap times, numbers, names etc. This 
      information can be presented on a scoreboard, computer or TV screen and 
      can be printed during and after the race or practice.</P>

   <P>
      ChronX is AMB's timing software for both professional and club racing. It 
      is designed for use with all TranX Pro systems, Tranx260, TranX160, AMB130 
      and Cyclip systems.</P>

   <P>
      In cooperation with AMB the StageRace program has been made capable to generate 
      files for ChronX.</P>

   <H2>
      Exporting 
   </H2>

   <P>
      As further described in the ChronX User Manual, text file import is possible, 
      with as result that imported competitors appear in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Competitor 
      Database</SPAN>.</P>

   <P>
         This database is organized with a division into multiple classes, each 
         containing a number of competitors forming a whole. Therefore StageRace 
         output is generated in such a way that the starting list for every distinct 
         half stage will appear in ChronX as a different class. This allowing 
         the operator to quickly choose the right set of competitors for a race.</P>

   <P>
      In order to have StageRace generating such output, the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Export 
      competitors for AMB ChronX</SPAN> option in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Tools</SPAN> 
      menu has to be chosen with the required half stage being selected. Note 
      that ChronX files can only be exported for one stage at a time.</P>

   <P>
      The location of the files generated depends on the path set in the 
      <A HREF="Options.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Options</SPAN> dialog</A>.</P>

   <P>
      For ChronX operation, please refer to the appropriate documentation.</P>

   <P>
      Output is generated in the form of a so-called Comma-Separated Values (CSV) 
      file of which the file name is set up as follows:</P>

   <BLOCKQUOTE> 
   <P CLASS="screenquote">
      [Race Title] - Competitors list [FS]-[HS] (ChronX).txt</P>

   </BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
      For instance:</P>

   <BLOCKQUOTE> 
   <P CLASS="screenquote">
      Ronde van Nederland - Competitors list 3-1 (ChronX).txt</P>

   </BLOCKQUOTE>
   <H2>
      File Set-up 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Every line in the file consists of:</P>

   <UL>
         <LI> Competitor's number</LI><LI> Competitor's name, nationality, team 
         and UCI code (for operator convenience only) </LI><LI> Transponder no. 
         </LI><LI> Class name </LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      The transponder no. equals to the starting number of the competitor. The 
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Transponder Translation Table</SPAN> should be 
      used to make the connection between competitors and their actual transponders.</P>

   <P>
      Class name has the following format:</P>

   <BLOCKQUOTE> 
   <P CLASS="screenquote">
      Competitors list [FS]-[HS] ([Race Title])</P>

   </BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
      For instance:</P>

   <BLOCKQUOTE> 
   <P CLASS="screenquote">
      Competitors list 3-1 (Ronde van Nederland)</P>

   </BLOCKQUOTE>
   <H2>
