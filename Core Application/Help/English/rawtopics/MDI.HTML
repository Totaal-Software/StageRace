   <P>
      StageRace fully supports the Windows<SUP>&reg;</sup> Multiple Document Interface, 
      which means that you can open:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI> Multiple event files simultaneously; and 
      <P>&nbsp;
      </P>

      <P>
         <IMG src="../screenshots/screen83.gif" width="215" height="156" ALT="MDI with multiple files open"></P>

      <P>&nbsp;
      </P>

      <P>
         Open multiple event files simultaneously for instance if you have multiple 
         races to administrate at the same time or want to copy competitors from 
         one file to another.</P>

      <P>
         Use <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Open</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">New</SPAN> 
         in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">File</SPAN> menu to create the first window 
         for an existing or a new event file.</P>

      </LI><LI>Multiple windows for the same event file simultaneously. 
      <P>&nbsp;
      </P>

      <P>
         <IMG src="../screenshots/screen85.gif" width="215" height="156" ALT="MDI with multiple views on one file"></P>

      <P>&nbsp;
      </P>

      <P>
         Open multiple windows for the same event file for instance if you need 
         to compare two classifications from the same event or to work on teams 
         and competitors at the same time.</P>

      <P>
         Use <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">New</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Window</SPAN> 
         menu to create the second or subsequent windows for an event file that 
         is already opened.</P>

      </LI>
   </UL>

   <H2>
      Close 
   </H2>

   <P>
      You can close windows by:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI> Single-clicking on the <span class="screenquote">&times;</span> icon 
      in the upper right corner of the window, using the left mouse button; or</LI><LI>Pressing 
      the Ctrl+F4 key combination on your keyboard.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      Once the last window is closing, StageRace closes the event file, if necessary 
      asking if saving is necessary.</P>

   <P>
      To close all windows at once, use <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Close</SPAN> in 
      the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">File</SPAN> menu.</P>
