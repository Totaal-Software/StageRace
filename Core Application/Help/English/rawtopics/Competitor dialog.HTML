      Competitor Properties Dialog 
   </H1>

   <P>
      The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Competitor properties</SPAN> dialog is displayed 
      when you insert or edit a competitor through the 
      <A HREF="Competitors%20view.html">
         competitors view</A>.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      This dialog lets you enter all properties of a competitor, namely:</P>

   <UL>
         <LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Start no.</SPAN>: the unique start number;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Name</SPAN>: 
         the name;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Team</SPAN>: the team that 
         you can choose from a list box where you can choose the team;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Country 
         code</SPAN>: the three-digit country code;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">UCI 
         code</SPAN>: the UCI code, preferably in the AAA99999999 format, such 
         as NED19770930;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">License</SPAN>: a non-standardized 
         license no., for instance from a national body's licensing system; </LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Category</SPAN>: 
         the category as it applies to this specific competitor; and</LI><LI>Masks: 
         assign this competitor to the 
         <A HREF="Masking.html">
         masks</A> that have been set-up for the event.</LI>
   </UL>

   <H2>
      New Team 
   </H2>

   <P>
      When, for the competitor that is being edited, the right team is not available, 
      you can add it on the spot, through the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">New team</SPAN> 
      button. You will get the 
      <A HREF="Team%20dialog.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Team properties</SPAN> dialog</A> to enter 
      the new team.</P>

   <H2>
      Start No. 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Competitor nos. can be changed at any time, but StageRace will require you 
      to enter a number that is not already used for any other competitor. Also, 
      this only works for competitors that are not used in an 
      <A HREF="Arrivals.html">
         arrival</A>.</P>

   <P>
      The only field that is really required is the start no. Other fields are 
      informatively only.</P>

   <P>
      However, a start no. can be zero, meaning this competitor is a 
      <A HREF="Competitors%20and%20teams.html#sparecompetitors">
         spare competitor</A>. You can also use the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Active</SPAN> 
      and <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Non-active</SPAN> radio buttons to change 
      between active and 
      <A HREF="Competitors%20and%20teams.html#sparecompetitors">
         spare competitor</A> respectively.</P>
