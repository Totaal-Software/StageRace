      Communiqu&eacute; Numbering 
   </H1>

   <P>
      Communiqu&eacute; numbering is the process of assigning ordinal numbers 
      to all publications of an event, as required by the UCI 
      <A HREF="UCI%20compliance.html">
         <span class="help_uci">(2.2.090 and 2.2.091)</span></A>.</P>

   <H2>
      Activation 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Communiqu&eacute; numbering must be switched on in the 
      <A HREF="Settings%20publication.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Publication</SPAN> section of the settings 
         dialog</A>.</P>

   <H2>
      Publishing 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Publications can be published in two steps:</P>

   <OL> <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><EM>Assign communiqu&eacute; number</EM><BR> 
   A number can be assigned to a document by stepping towards the desired number 
   using Decrement publication no. or Increment publication no. in the Edit menu. 
   The current number for a publication is shown in a bar (read below) at the 
   top of the 
   <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">
      event tree</A>. Numbers that are already in use with published communiqu&eacute;s, 
   will be skipped.</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><EM>Publish</EM><BR> A publication 
   can effectively be published by checking the appropriate check boxes in the 
   <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">
      event tree</A> using Publish in the Edit menu. A communiqu&eacute; number 
   has to be assigned before publication can be checked, as explained above. The 
   chosen communiqu&eacute; number may not be in use already for the publishing 
   to work.</LI></OL>
   <p>
      Note the distinct difference between publishing and generating.</p>

   <H2>
      Generating 
   </H2>

   <P>
      If a document is not yet effectively published as described above, the communiqu&eacute; 
      number will be omitted entirely during generating.</P>

   <P>
      On published documents, the communiqu&eacute; number will be printed, the 
      next time it is generated.</P>

   <P>
      The 
      <A HREF="Table%20of%20contents.html">
         table of contents</A> for an event will also display the communiqu&eacute; 
      numbers. When communiqu&eacute; numbering is activated, the 
      <A HREF="Table%20of%20contents.html">
         table of contents</A> will only list those publications that are actually 
      effectively published, so that you can let an online 
      <a href="Table%20of%20contents.html">
         table of contents</a> grow during the event.</P>

   <H2>
      Communiqu&eacute; Number Bar 
   </H2>

   <P>
      The communiqu&eacute; number bar is displayed at the top of the 
      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">
         event tree</A>.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   
<P> <IMG src="../screenshots/screen82.gif" width="338" height="298" ALT="Communiqu&eacute; number bar"></P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      It shows the number that is currently assigned to a publication.</P>

   <P>
      The color used for displaying the number is indicative for the usage of 
      the number's value; namely:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI><EM>Red</EM>: the number is in use by this publication that is actually 
      effectively published (as in the picture above);</LI><LI><EM>Yellow</EM>: 
      the number is in use by another publication; and</LI><LI><EM>Green</EM>: 
      the number is available for this publication, but it is not yet published.</LI>
   </UL>

   
<p> When communiqu&eacute; numbering is switched off, the communiqu&eacute; number 
  bar is hidden.</p>
<h2>Auto-Number Communiqu&eacute;s</h2>
<p>Use the <span class="screenquote">Auto-number communiqu&eacute;s</span> dialog 
  to automatically number all the communiqu&eacute;s that are not currently published. 
  You can find the <span class="screenquote">Auto-number communiqu&eacute;s</span> 
  dialog through <span class="help_menu">Auto-Number Communiqu&eacute;s...</span> 
  in the <span class="help_menu">Edit</span> menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../screenshots/screen1.gif" width="489" height="237" alt="Auto-number communiqu&eacute;s"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the <span class="screenquote">Auto-number communiqu&eacute;s</span> dialog 
  you can choose if you want to include certain types of publications that are 
  not always required to have communiqu&eacute; numbers, namely: cross out lists, 
  sign in lists, general classifications sorted on start no.</p>

            publications. For instance very exceptional classifications or informative 
            race reports can be foreseen with a communiqu&eacute; number that 
            nevertheless fits into StageRace's communiqu&eacute; numbering nicely.
