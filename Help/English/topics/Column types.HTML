      With communiqu&eacute;s and the 
      <A HREF="Table%20of%20contents.html">
         table of contents</A> as exceptions, all StageRace publications use one 
      or more tables as the document body. Every type of publication has its own 
      set of applicable columns, and the columns that are actually used can be 
      chosen.</P>
