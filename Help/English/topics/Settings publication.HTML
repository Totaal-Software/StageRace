  menu, and then choosing for the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Publication</SPAN> 
  tab, you can lay down the exact contents that is printed on publications.</P>
<P>When the small size of the settings control holds you back from properly making 
  the settings, you can maximize the control in which you make these settings, 
  by double-clicking on any whitespace in the control.</P>

<P> <IMG src="../screenshots/screen27.gif" width="602" height="542" ALT="Settings publication"></P>
<P>&nbsp; </P>
<P>The following publication settings can be made. These settings are among the 
  most powerful that are available in StageRace.</P>
<h2>Communique Numbering</h2>
<P>You can enable the <A HREF="Communiqu%E9%20numbering.html"> communiqu&eacute; 
  numbering system</A>.</P>
<h2>Header</h2>
<p>You can fully configure the contents of the <A HREF="Header%20information.html">publication 
  header</A>:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Choose to print a recognition string in the top left corner of publications, 
    and if it must be repeated on subsequent pages;</li>
  <li>Choose to print the event title and subtitle and set its alignment;</li>
  <li>Choose the alignment of the event logo;</li>
  <li>Choose whether subtitles must be replaced or accompanied by the appropriate 
    classification sponsors or that the sponsors must not be printed at all; and</li>
  <li>Select the property labels that are printed at the top of publications and 
    if labels and values are printed side-by-side or under each other.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Body</h2>
<p> You can fully configure the <a href="Column%20types.html">columns for publications</a>.</p>
<p>Note that here you can set the printing of higher accuracy that is used for 
  time trials to be applied only when it involves two consecutive competitors 
  having a draw in the full seconds time <a href="UCI%20compliance.html"> <span class="help_uci">(2.4.016, 
  2.5.012)</span></a> or even switch off higher accuracy times altogether, no 
  matter it being a time trial.</p>
<p>Note that you can have competitors lists on teams be printed in a number of 
  columns, selected between one and six.</p>
<p>You can set the token that is used as indicator instead of gap times that are 
  equal to the previous ones in <a href="Column%20types.html"> <span class="screenquote"> 
  Gap for new time only</span> columns</a>.</p>
<h2>Footer</h2>
<p>You can fully configure the <A HREF="Footer%20information.html">publication

    in compact form;</li>

  <li>Enable printing of a time stamp, with optional time zone information, and 
    give its accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can enter the text that is printed as <a href="Footer%20information.html"> 
  signature</a>. The entered signature can be name plus title of the chairman 
  of the jury, for instance.</p>
<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>You can select the <a href="MultiLanguage%20strings.html"> languages</a> that 
  are used on publications. Available languages are shown, and can be added, already 
  previously added languages can be removed.</p>
<h2>Cross Out Lists</h2>
<p>The way <a href="Cross%20out%20lists.html">cross out lists</a> look can be 
  chosen. You can choose to include team names, competitor names or both. For 
  when team names are included, the amount of competitors on each row of the <a href="Cross%20out%20lists.html"> 
  cross out list</a> can be set.</p>
<h2>Mask Indicators</h2>
<p>You can enter the tokens that are used as indicator for a <a href="Masking.html">

  but HTML text like <span class="screenquote">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;logo.gif&quot;

<p>The choices made here only apply if the particular mask is activated in the 
  <a href="Settings%20general.html"> general settings</a>.</p>
<p>This can only be entered for masks 1, 2 and 3. The other masks will automatically 
  be indicated as M4, M5, et cetera.</p>

  affects speeds. Note that this setting only applies to publications, not to 
  exported files.</p>

  in normal or reverse order, and where to print the references to competitors 
  lists (top or bottom).</p>
<h2>Advertisement</h2>
<p>You can enable your own advertisement information at the bottom of each publication, 
  rather than just a short StageRace one-liner, and choose if and how there is 
  a hyperlink included, and enter the text for the advertisement. You can enter 
  the name and one extra informative line about the party that is in charge of 
  the classification service for the event.</p>
