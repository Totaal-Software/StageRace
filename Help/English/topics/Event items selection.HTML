      Event Items Selection 
   </H1>

   
<P> Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Event items selection</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">View</SPAN> 
  menu you can prepare a list of publications (from the current event) that you 
  can use at a later point to quickly copy, print, upload or e-mail.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   
<P> <IMG src="../screenshots/screen77.gif" width="358" height="214" ALT="Event items selection dialog"></P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <H2>
      Adding Items 
   </H2>

   <P>
      You can add items to the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Event items selection</SPAN> 
      dialog by:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>Dragging an item from the 
      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">
         event tree</A> to the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Event items selection</SPAN> 
      dialog; or</LI><LI>Selecting an item in the 
      <A HREF="Event%20tree.html">
         event tree</A> and choosing <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Copy to selection 
      dialog</SPAN> from the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> menu.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      Naturally you can only add items that have publications associated with 
      them. It is, however, allowed to add publication items for which the publication 
      is not actually generated yet.</P>

   <H2>
      Removing items 
   </H2>

   <P>
      When you select an item in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Event items selection</SPAN> 
      dialog, you can remove it from the dialog by clicking <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Clear</SPAN>. 
   </P>

   <H2>
      Number of Copies 
   </H2>

   <P>
      You can set the number of copies for each item that is in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Event 
      items selection</SPAN> dialog.</P>

   <P>
      When you select an item in the dialog, you can set the number of copies 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Copies</SPAN> edit box.</P>

   <P>
      Using the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Total copies</SPAN> edit box you again 
      multiply the number of copies that is set for each individual item.</P>

   <P>
      The number of copies clearly only applies to printing of publications.</P>

   
<H2>Copy</H2>
<p>Copy the items from the <span class="screenquote">Event items selection</span> 
  dialog to al alternate file location.</p>
<p>Through the <span class="screenquote">Browse for Folder</span> dialog you can 
  select the destination (folder) to use as a destination for the copy.</p>
<h2>Print</h2>
<p>Print the items from the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Event items selection</SPAN> 
  dialog in the number of copies as set.</p>
<P>
      For speed, you will not be asked for a printer choice or any other confirmation. 
      The last printer that you used from within StageRace or alternatively your 
      default printer will be used.</P>

   <P>
      A simple printing algorithm is used for doing this. Each copy of each publication 
      that you print will be a separate print job. Therefore, if you need many 
      copies of the same publication, it might be better to use the basic 
      <A HREF="Publication%20view.html">
         print function of the publication view</A>.</P>

   <H2>
      Mail 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Your system's default e-mail client will be invoked, composing a new e-mail 
      message of which the body is filled with 
      <A HREF="Settings%20general.html">
         general settings</A> information and with the items from the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Event 
      items selection</SPAN> dialog as an attachment.</P>

   <P>
      Using the invoked e-mail client you still have to supply the addressees 
      and actually send off the message.</P>

   <H2>
      Upload 
   </H2>

   <P>
      The items from the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Event items selection</SPAN> 
      dialog will be 
      <A HREF="Upload.html">
         uploaded</A> to an internet location, using the FTP protocol. The 
      <A HREF="Settings%20upload.html">
         upload settings</A> apply to this function.</P>

   <H2>
      Example of Use 
   </H2>

   <P>
      When a half stage arrival is upcoming, you already know which publications 
      the jury will be asking for. You can already add these to the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Event 
      items selection</SPAN> dialog so that you can speed up the process of printing 
      once the arrival data is processed.</P>
