      Publications Header Information 
   </H1>

   <P>
      Headers of publications consist of the following elements.</P>

   <P>
      Where not mentioned differently, the 
      <A HREF="Settings%20publication.html">
         publication settings</A> apply for adjusting the described elements.</P>

   <H2>
      Document Recognition String 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Every document recognition string uniquely identifies the publication that 
      it is on. It consists of the stage and half stage number, as far as applicable, 
      together with a short description of the publication. The document recognition 
      string is copied on every new page, but this is only visible in browser 
      that support a sufficiently high version of CSS. </P>

   <H2>
      Event Title and Logo 
   </H2>

   <P>
      The event title and sub title as entered in the 
      <A HREF="Settings%20general.html">
         general settings</A> can be printed at the top of the first page of the 
      document. It can be left, center or right aligned.</P>

   <P>
      Also an event logo can be included through the 
      <A HREF="Settings%20HTML.html">
         HTML settings</A> and it can be left, center or right aligned. The event 
      logo is not actually included in the event file, but merely referred by 
      the generated HTML documents. Therefore you should provide a sufficiently 
      qualified URL or path. You can just enter the file name, in which case the 
      file is assumed to be in the same folder as the publications. But you can 
      also enter a full internet address of the file or a directory path to it. 
      Note that when you provide a local or even networked directory path, the 
      file is likely not to be accessible when other users view your publications 
      over the internet.</P>

   <P>
      The event logo is not 
      <a href="Upload.html">
         uploaded</a> by StageRace.</P>
