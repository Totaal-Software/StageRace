<H1> Profiles</H1>

   
<p> A <em>profile</em> is a combined set of <a href="Settings%20publication.html">publication 
  settings</a>, <a href="Settings%20HTML.html">HTML settings</a> and <a href="Settings%20upload.html">upload 
  settings</a> that are tailored for a specific purpose or audience.</p>
<p>Typical profiles would be &quot;web&quot;, &quot;jury&quot;, &quot;press&quot;, 
  but you can configure this any way you like. Imagine here that the jury wants 
  different <a href="Column%20types.html">columns</a> of information included 
  than the press, and that the layout (e.g. colors) for web publishing is very 
  different from printed publications.</p>
<p>As many additional profiles can be added as you desire.</p>
<p>You can set the current profile in the <a href="Profile%20picker.html"><span class="screenquote">Profile 
  picker</span> dialog</a> that you can find through <span class="help_menu">Profile 
  picker...</span> in the <span class="help_menu">Configure</span> menu. Setting 
  a profile affects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="Settings.html">settings dialog</a>, which will show the <a href="Settings%20publication.html">publication 
    settings</a>, <a href="Settings%20HTML.html">HTML settings</a> and <a href="Settings%20upload.html">upload 
    settings</a> specific for the currently set profile;</li>
  <li>The <a href="Publication%20view.html">publication view</a>, that will exclusively 
    show publications for the currently set profile; and</li>
  <li>The <a href="Generate.html">generating of publications</a>, because only 
    publications are being <a href="Generate.html">generated</a> for the currently 
    set profile. This means that you'll have to switch profiles and <a href="Generate.html">generate</a> 
    publications subsequently.</li>
</ul>
<p>A shortcut to setting the current profile is the <a href="Profile%20picker.html"><span class="screenquote">Profile 
  picker</span> dialog</a> drop-down box in the <a href="Tool%20bars.html">standard 
  toolbar</a>.</p>
<p>All profiles share the same <a href="Settings%20general.html">general settings</a>, 
  <a href="Settings%20ranking.html">ranking settings</a> and <a href="Settings%20access.html">access 
  settings</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="Publication%20names.html">publication file names</a> will represent 
  the profile name for which they have been <a href="Generate.html">generated</a>. 
  However, if there is only a single profile for an event, the profile name will 
  not be represented in the <a href="Publication%20names.html">publication file 
  names</a>.</p>
