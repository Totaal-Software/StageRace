      Control Import Classification Dialog 
   </H1>

   <P>
      The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Control import classification</SPAN> dialog 
      appears just before 
      <A HREF="Import.html">
         import data</A> are actually processed.</P>

   <P>
         It appears only when in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Import classification</SPAN> 
         file dialog a file type is chosen for which it is not possible to determine 
         unambiguously how to treat the source files.</P>

   <H2>
      Main file type 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Choose the file type between: 

   <UL>
      <LI> Omega Scan'O'Vision Data Handling; or</LI><LI>Text file import (thus 
      all other types).</LI>
   </UL>

   <H2>
      Scan'O'Vision Data Handling 
   </H2>

   <P>
         The Scan'O'Vision Data Handling file type makes specific use of events, 
         rounds and heats. Set <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Event, round, heat</SPAN> 
         to match the choices made in the Scan'O'Vision program.</P>

   <P>
      When you use 
      <A HREF="Export%20ScanOVision%20file%20format.html">
         Data Handling files exported by StageRace</A> the <EM>event</EM> will 
      match the stage no. and <EM>round</EM> will match the half stage no.</P>

   <H2>
      Text File Import 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Text file import can be used for many different file types, and therefore 
      needs some settings:</P>

   <H3>
      Column Borders 
   </H3>

   <P>
      StageRace needs to know where it can find the three required columns <EM>rank</EM>, 
      <EM>start no.</EM> and <EM>time</EM>. This can be done in two ways, depending 
      on the type of file: </P>

   <UL>
         <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Fixed length</SPAN> 
         (as in the illustrated example)<BR> The columns exist on the same horizontal 
         positions on every line. You need to set the column positions by entering 
         the start and end positions for all three required columns. If a column 
         contains information of different widths, the remaining space is filled 
         up by blanks, so that the next field starts on the correct horizontal 
         position again.</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Delimited 
         by separator</SPAN><BR> The columns (or fields) on each line in the file 
         are separated by a unique separator token. You can select the separator 
         token from the following: <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">tab</SPAN>, comma, 
         semi-colon, &quot;|&quot;, &quot;%&quot; and &quot;/&quot;. You also 
         need to set the index of the separator after which the columns are expected. 
         For instance: if the start no. in your import file appears after the 
         fourth separator, you set the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Start no. column 
         position</SPAN> to 4.</LI>
   </UL>

   
<p> Note that from the character strings that you import only the numerals are 
  used. Other characters are simply ignored. This way, for instance, it is allowed 
  for values to be enclosed by quotation marks. But also all other non-numerals 
  are ignored.</p>
<p>When you use <span class="screenquote">Delimited by separator</span> for a 
  file in which text fields exist that are enclosed by quotes, any occurances 
  of the separator token within such fields will be ignored.</p>

   <H3>
      Various Settings 
   </H3>

   <UL>
      <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Header size</SPAN><BR> 
      The number of lines that is entered here, will be ignored at the top of 
      the source file, as a header. (See the illustration.) This header is previewed 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Header</SPAN> field. The remaining part 
      of the source file &#151; which will actually be processed &#151; is visible 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Data preview</SPAN> field.</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Decimals</SPAN><BR> 
      The accuracy (in number of decimals) in which the rider's time is provided 
      in the file. Note that this depends on the column borders that are set (described 
      before).</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Recalculate 
      rankings</SPAN><BR> If not checked, the rankings will be taken from the 
      source file. If checked, the rankings will be recalculated, looking at the 
      rankings and times from the source file. With this function, gaps in the 
      rankings from the source file can be removed automatically.</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Times' 
      notation</SPAN><BR> Choose whether times in the file are provided as a formatted 
      string of the h/mm/ss form (as in the illustrated example) or as a multiple 
      of seconds.</LI>
   </UL>

   <H3>
      Example 
   </H3>

   <P>
      The example shows a file that can be imported. The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Header 
      size</SPAN> has to be set to 8, <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Rank column position</SPAN> 
      from 0 to 3, <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Start no. column position</SPAN> 
      from 7 to 11, <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Time column position</SPAN> form 
      73 to 83, <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Decimals</SPAN> to 4 and <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Times' 
      notation</SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Divided into h/min/s</SPAN>. 
      Don't forget that you first need to have chose <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Text 
      file import</SPAN>.</P>

   <P>
         In order to quickly retrieve default presets for known file types, buttons 
         are available in the upper right corner of the dialog. Note that, since 
         most of these are not-unambiguous file types, you still might need to 
         do some tweaking.</P>

   <P>
      As much as appropriate, the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Control import classification</SPAN> 
      dialog will remember the settings you make, for future use.</P>
