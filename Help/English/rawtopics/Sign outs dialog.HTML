      Managing Sign Outs 
   </H2>

   <P>
      In the dialog, the start no. and reason for a sign out can be entered. Then, 
      through the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Add</SPAN> button, the competitor 
      is added to the list of sign outs.</P>

   <P>
      Note that the start no. that you enter is validated, so that you can only 
      add existing and available competitors to the list.</P>

   <P>
      If you select a signed out competitor from the list, you can delete it from 
      the list through the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Delete</SPAN> button.</P>

   <H2>
      Reasons 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Previously used sign out reasons are remembered and can easily be retrieved 
      from the drop-down box <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Reason</SPAN>.</P>

   <P>
      Sign out reasons are merely informative.</P>
