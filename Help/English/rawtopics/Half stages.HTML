      An event is divided into 
      <A HREF="Full%20stages.html">
         full stages or days</A>. Next, every such

   <P>
      A half stage is the only thing in StageRace that actually requires competitors 
      to do any work; it represents them riding from A to B (or from A to A, for 
      that matter).</P>

      The following parameters can be entered:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Title</SPAN><BR> Enter 
      the title of the half stage. <BR> Often the start and finish locations of

      or &quot;Paris-Roubaix&quot;.</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Opening

      this is an informational field and is not used in any calculations.</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Distance: 
      ... rounds of ... meters</SPAN><BR> Enter the number of rounds and the distance 
      per round.<BR> The number of rounds should always be one or more. Therefore, 
      with city-to-city events the number of rounds is normally one exactly and 
      the total distance will be entered directly as it is.<BR> For time trials 
      the number of rounds is forced to one.<br> What you enter is always interpreted 
      as a <em>meters</em> value. Even if you choose to print only <em>miles</em> 
      values on 
      <a href="Settings%20publication.html">
         publications</a>, you still have to enter values in meters here.</LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Time
