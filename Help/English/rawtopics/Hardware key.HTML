      Hardware key 
   </H1>

   <P>
      StageRace software is protected by use of a hardware key. Without the hardware 
      key your copy will work in 
      <A HREF="Evaluation%20mode.html">
         evaluation mode</A>.</P>

   <P>
      A hardware key is a piece of electronics; matchbox sized, or smaller. This 
      key has to be connected to your computer.</P>

   <P>
      We provide two types of keys, namely:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>For a printer port (also referred to as LPT port); and 
      <P>
         <br> <IMG src="../images/hasp_lpt.jpg" width="132" height="117" ALT="Hardware key LPT"><br> 
         <br> Every modern computer is equipped with such a printer port. An eventual 
         printer connected can again be connected to the hardware key. Both can 
         then use the same printer port simultaneously, without trouble.</P>

      </LI>
   </UL>

   <UL>
      <LI>For a USB port. 
      <P>
         <br> <IMG src="../images/hasp_usb.jpg" width="173" height="71" ALT="Hardware key USB"><br> 
         <br> USB hubs allow for connecting multiple USB devices to your computer 
         simultaneously. Or possibly your computer is already equipped with sufficient 
         ports.</P>

      </LI>

      Device Driver 
   </H2>

   <P>
      A device driver is required for the hardware key to work. It will be installed 
      during 
      <A HREF="Program%20installation.html">
         installation process</A>.</P>

   <P>
         Note that only registered users will have a proper hardware key at their 
         disposal. Therefore installation of the device driver is only necessary 
         for registrated users.</P>

   <H2>
      Troubleshooting 
   </H2>

   <P>
      StageRace uses a well known brand hardware keys of excellent quality. Whenever 
      the key does not want to work together with your peripheral equipment, please 
      contact your computer dealer. Over the past five years there are no problems 
      known to Totaal Software, arising from the use of this particular type of 
      hardware keys.</P>

   <H2>
      Checking Key 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Make sure that the hardware key is connected to the correct port and that 
      Stagerace is installed correctly. Next, you can check your hardware key's 
      properties in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Help</SPAN> menu's <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">About</SPAN> 
      box.</P>

   <P>
      When your hardware key is recognized by StageRace, you'll find this information 
      in the particular window:</P>

   <BLOCKQUOTE> 
   <P>
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Detected "Totaal" key no. 12345...</SPAN> (with 
      the unique code of the particular key)</P>

   <P>
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">STAGERAC V2.99 01-01-2003</SPAN> (with the maximal 
      version number for which the particular hardware key is suitable, including 
      the date of issuance of the key)</P>

   </BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
      When your hardware key is not recognized by StageRace, you'll find this 
      information in the particular window:</P>

   <BLOCKQUOTE> 
   <P>
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Invalid or missing hardware key</SPAN></P>

   <P>
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote"> No registration information available</SPAN></P>

   </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>
         Ergo, hardware keys for StageRace have an internal version number. Keys 
         can be updated in the future, in order to let you use more up to date 
         program versions. This upgrading can by done by Totaal Software remotely.</P>
