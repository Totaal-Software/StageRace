      Exclude From General

   <P>
      Often, team time trials only count towards the

         teams classification</A> and <EM>not</EM> to the 
      <A HREF="Rules%20general%20classifications.html">
         general individual classification</A>. Therefore you can choose a 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         half stage</A> not to count towards the general classification, through 
      the 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">

      Only Count Deciding Competitor 
   </H2>

   <P>
      The first so many competitors that arrive from a team, are normally given 
      the same time in a team time trial. This would result in the exact same 
      time being added repeatedly to the team's total race time in the 
      <A HREF="Rules%20teams%20classifications.html">
         teams classification</A>, which is often undesired. Therefore you can 
      choose for each team only the time of one of its competitors to count towards 
      the 
      <A HREF="Rules%20teams%20classifications.html">
         teams classification</A>, through the 
      <A HREF="Half%20stages.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Half stage settings</SPAN> dialog</A>. Note 
      that the <EM>deciding competitor</EM> will be the competitor whose time 
      is used. This competitor can be chosen from the 
      <A HREF="Settings%20ranking.html">
         ranking settings</A> for 
      <A HREF="Rules%20teams%20classifications.html">

      Starting Order 
   </H2>

   <P>
      The 
      <A HREF="Time%20trial%20starting%20order%20dialog.html">
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Time trial starting order</SPAN> dialog</A> 
      allows to automatically generate a team time trial starting order 
      <a href="UCI%20compliance.html">
         <span class="help_uci">(2.6.023)</span></a>, based on the latest 
      <A HREF="Rules%20teams%20classifications.html">

   <H2>
      Bonuses 
   </H2>

   <P>
      Some races, while not counting a team time trial towards the general individual 
      classification (see above), award bonus seconds to individual competitors 
      based on their team's results. This can be facilitated using 
      <A HREF="Corrections.html">
         time corrections (bonuses)</A>.
