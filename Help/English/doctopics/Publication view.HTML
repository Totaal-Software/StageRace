   <P>
      If in the 
      
         event tree an item is selected that has a publication associated 
      with it, the publication view will be visible, displaying this publication. 
      However, if the publication is not actually generated yet, a blank view 
      is displayed rather than the publication view.</P>

   <P>
      
         Publications are in the form of separate HTML files, which is the 
      leading internet document file type. Therefore the publication view is in 
      fact an internet browser.</P>

   <P>
      While the publication view is visible, the following functions are available:</P>
