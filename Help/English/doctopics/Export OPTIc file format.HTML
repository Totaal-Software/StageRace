      Export Competitors for Alge OPTIc 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Competitors can be exported from StageRace so they can be used in Alge OPTIc.</P>

   <P>
      Note that you can also import OPTIc files for 
      
         ranking a stage. </P>

   <H4>
      Introduction 
   </H4>

   <P>
      Alge Timing, with a worldwide network of distributors is a specialist for 
      sports timing with over 30 years of experience in timing consultancy, development 
      and production.</P>

   <P>
      Alge OPTIc is a computerized color photo finish system with integrated processing 
      software. The Color Line Scan Camera scans every movement on the finish 
      line in true color and high resolution.</P>

   <P>
      In cooperation with Alge the StageRace program has been made capable to 
      generate files for OPTIc.</P>

   <H4>
      Exporting 
   </H4>

   <P>
      As further described in the OPTIc help files, text file import is possible 
      (<SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Import competitor list...</SPAN>), after which 
      imported competitors immediately can be used in the race being judged.</P>

   <P>
      In order to have StageRace generating such output files, the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Export 
      competitors for Alge OPTIc</SPAN> option in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Tools</SPAN> 
      menu has to be chosen with the required half stage being selected. Note 
      that OPTIc files can only be exported for one stage at a time.</P>

   <P>
      The location of the files generated depends on the path set in the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Options</SPAN> dialog.</P>

   <P>
      For OPTIc operation, please refer to the appropriate documentation.</P>

   <P>
      Output is generated in the form of a so-called tab separated file of which 
      the file name is set up as follows:</P>

   <BLOCKQUOTE> 
   <P CLASS="screenquote">
      [Race Title] - Competitors list [FS]-[HS] (OPTIc).txt</P>

   </BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
      For instance:</P>

   <BLOCKQUOTE> 
   <P CLASS="screenquote">
      Ronde van Nederland - Competitors list 3-1 (OPTIc).txt</P>

   </BLOCKQUOTE>
   <H4>
      File Set-up 
   </H4>

   <P>
      Every line in the file consists of:</P>

   <UL>
         <LI> Competitor's number</LI><LI> Competitor's name and team code (for 
         operator convenience only)</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      The team code will appear in the OPTIc program as the nationality field.</P>

   <H4>
      Example 
   </H4>

   <P>
      A typical file looks like this: </P>
