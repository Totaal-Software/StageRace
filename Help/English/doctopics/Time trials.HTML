   <P>
      Every 
      
         half stage can be a time trial.</P>

   <P>
      Time trials are treated distinctly different than regular 
      
         half stages. The differences are:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI> For a time trial a starting order and starting times have to be entered 
      in the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Time trial starting order</SPAN> dialog;</LI><LI>Competitors 
      get their ranking automatically based on the time that they ride, rather 
      than the actual ranking being entered;</LI><LI>Optionally, gross times can 
      be entered which are automatically calculated into net times, based on the 
      starting time; and</LI><LI>For time trials no 
      
         cross out lists are generated.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      A 
      
         half stage can be set to be a time trial by use of the tab sheet 
      <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Half stage settings</SPAN> of the 
      
         configuration of the particular half stage. This can be found through 
      <SPAN CLASS="help_menu"> Configure selection...</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configuration</SPAN> 
      menu, when the appropriate 
      
         half stage is selected in the 
      
         event tree.</P>

      Time Trial 
   </H6>

   <P>
      When you set a 
      
         half stage to be a time trial, the number of rounds is automatically 
      set to <EM>one</EM>, and the net or gross time selection becomes available. 
      After confirmation the 
      
         event tree is updated, displaying the time trial and the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Starting 
      order</SPAN> within.</P>

   <H6>
      Net or Gross 
   </H6>

   <P>
      There are two modes for time trials:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI CLASS="li_extensive"><EM><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Input gross times</SPAN></EM><SPAN CLASS="li_extensive"><BR>The 
      arrival time that is entered is the time between the start of the <EM>first</EM> 
      competitor and the finish of the concerning competitor. StageRace will take 
      the entered time and subtract from this the start time of the concerning 
      competitor. For this the starting order of the time trial is used.</SPAN></LI><LI CLASS="li_extensive"><EM><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Input 
      net times</SPAN></EM><BR>The arrival time that is entered is exactly the 
      time that it took that competitor to finish the race. The 
      
         starting order of the time trial is only used informatively.</LI>
