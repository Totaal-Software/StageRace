   <P>
      While the

   <P>
      The width of the displayed columns can be adjusted by dragging the little 
      separation line between two column headers.</P>

   <P>
      The various columns can be rearranged by clicking on a column header and 
      dragging it to the desired location.</P>

   <P>
      By clicking on a column header, the list will be sorted on that particular 
      column's contents. By clicking the same column header again, the sorting 
      order will be reversed.</P>

      menu you can at once select all competitors.</P>

   <H4>

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Competitor/Team</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Insert</SPAN> 
      menu a new competitor can be inserted into the competitors view. The 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Edit competitor</SPAN> dialog will appear, 
      allowing for the details of this new competitor to be entered.</P>

   <P>
      If <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Repeatedly</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Insert</SPAN> 
      menu is checked, you will repeatedly be getting the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Edit competitor</SPAN> dialog, in order 
      to speed up the process of entering competitors. If you want to stop, you 
      cancel the current 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote"> Edit competitor</SPAN> dialog.</P>

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Delete</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> 
      menu one or more selected competitors can be deleted. However, only competitors 
      can be deleted that are not used in an 
      
         arrival.</P>

   <H4>
      Edit 
   </H4>

   <P>
      Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit selection...</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> 
      menu one selected competitor can be edited. For this the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote"> 
      
      </SPAN> 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Edit competitor</SPAN> dialog is displayed.</P>

   <P>
      If you only want to change the competitor's start no., you can do that <EM>in-line</EM> 
      by long-clicking the selected competitor.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;
   </P>

   <P>
      A small edit box will appear at the place of the start no., where you can

      Clipboard 
   </H4>

   <P>
      
         Cut, copy and paste competitors through the Windows<SUP>&reg;</SUP> clipboard.</P>

   <P>
      Note that if the competitor nos. in the competitors view are grayed out, 
      this is a result of <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Paste with start nos.</SPAN> 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> menu, which is also part of the 
      
         clipboard functionality.</P>

   </UL>

   <P>
      When two competitors are selected, they can be swapped trough <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Swap 
      competitors</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Edit</SPAN> menu. Swapping 
      means that the two competitors exchange start nos. while keeping the rest 
      of their properties (name, team, etcetera).</P>

   <P>
      Swapping can be done between two active competitors, but also between an 
      active competitor and a 
      
         spare competitor.</P>

   <P>
      This is a very handy function when last-minute a competitor needs replacing 
      by a 
      
         spare competitor, or to shuffle competitors within a team during 
      registration of the team (or between teams if you would want to).</P>

   <H4>
      Masking 
   </H4>

   <P>
      Automatically assign a number of competitors to one of the 
      
         masks using the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Apply a mask</SPAN> dialog.</P>
