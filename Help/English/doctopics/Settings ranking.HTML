<P> Through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Settings...</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Configure</SPAN> 
  menu, and then choosing for the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Ranking</SPAN> tab, 
  you can edit the settings that determine how  
  rules are applied for generating classifications.</P>
<P>When the small size of the settings control holds you back from properly making 
  the settings, you can maximize the control in which you make these settings, 
  by double-clicking on any whitespace in the control. </P>

<P> The following ranking settings can be made.</P>
<h5>Individual Classifications</h5>
<P>You can set the way how classifications are sorted, for  
  general classifications,  
  sprint classifications,  
  points classifications,  
  climbing classifications. You can also set the last solution that must be 
  used for draws in several of the classifications, between the last stage ranking 
  and the last general classification.</P>
<P>Specifically for sprint classifications 
  you can choose whether the sprint at the stage finish should be considered while 
  calculating the general classifications and if the points that are obtained 
  at the stage finish should be listed explicitly.</P>
<P>Specifically for  climbing 
  classifications you can choose whether the difference in categories should 
  be considered while calculating the general classifications.</P>
<h5>General Classifications on Start No.</h5>
<P>You can choose to generate general classifications that are sorted on start 
  no. rather than on rank.</P>
<h5>Teams Classifications</h5>
<P>You can enable the generation of teams classifications and set the way how 
   general teams classifications 
  and  stage teams classifications 
  are sorted. Also you can select which competitor's ranking must be used as the 
  last solution for draws (&quot;deciding competitor&quot;) in the  
  general teams classification (first of last of the bunch).</P>
<P>The  bunch size for teams 
  classifications can be entered as a value of at least 2 and at most </P>
<h5>Calculations</h5>
<P>The rank (depth) up to which &quot;Most high rankings&quot; calculations must 
  be done; this way making a trade-off between calculation speed and accuracy. 
  However, when the number set for <span class="screenquote">Stage arrivals</span> 
  is larger than the last ranking that you expect (normally the number of competitors 
  in the race), and the number set for <span class="screenquote">Intermediate 
  sprints</span> is larger than the maximum amount of points that is awarded for 
  any involved sprint, you have optimal accuracy guaranteed.</P>
