      Team Time Trials

      StageRace facilitates in the special demands that exist for team time trials

   <H3>
      Exclude From General 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Often, team time trials only count towards the 
      
         teams classification and <EM>not</EM> to the 
      
         general individual classification. Therefore you can choose a 
      
         half stage not to count towards the general classification, through 
      the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Half stage settings</SPAN> dialog. 
      
         <span class="help_uci">This possibility contradicts with rule 2.6.024.</span>

      Only Count Deciding Competitor 
   </H3>

   <P>
      The first so many competitors that arrive from a team, are normally given 
      the same time in a team time trial. This would result in the exact same 
      time being added repeatedly to the team's total race time in the 
      
         teams classification, which is often undesired. Therefore you can 
      choose for each team only the time of one of its competitors to count towards 
      the 
      
         teams classification, through the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Half stage settings</SPAN> dialog. Note 
      that the <EM>deciding competitor</EM> will be the competitor whose time 
      is used. This competitor can be chosen from the 
      
         ranking settings for 
      
         teams classifications. 

   <H3>
      Starting Order 
   </H3>

   <P>
      The 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Time trial starting order</SPAN> dialog 
      allows to automatically generate a team time trial starting order 
      
         <span class="help_uci">(2.6.023)</span>, based on the latest 
      
         general teams classification.</P>

   <H3>
      Bonuses 
   </H3>

   <P>
      Some races, while not counting a team time trial towards the general individual 
      classification (see above), award bonus seconds to individual competitors 
      based on their team's results. This can be facilitated using 
      
         time corrections (bonuses).
