      Table of Contents 
   </H3>

   <P>
      You can generate a table of contents through <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Table 
      of contents</SPAN> in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Generate</SPAN> menu.</P>

   <P>
      The table of contents includes references (hyperlinks) to all the publications 
      that are part of the event (except for 
      
         sign in lists).</P>

   <P>
      However, if you use 
      
         communiqu&eacute; numbering, only the publications that are yet 
      
         published are included in the table of contents.</P>

   <H4>
      
      Index File 
   </H4>

   <P>
      The table of contents can be generated with a file name that differs from 
      the 
      
         naming convention that is used for all other publications. It can 
      be <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">index.html</SPAN>. This way, when uploading 
      your event's publications to a dedicated directory on your web server, the 
      event will be easily accessible over the internet by only using this directory's 
      name (depending on server configuration). You can set this in the 
      
         HTML settings.</P>

   <P>
      When <span class="screenquote"> index.html</span> is used
      
       it is not longer possible for StageRace to determine whether a supposed 
      table of contents file actually applies to the particular event. There is 
      a risk that it uses a wrong <span class="screenquote">index.html</span> 
      for e.g. 
      
         printing, 
      
         uploading or displaying in the 
      
         event tree. You can prevent this by examining (and possibly 
      
         regenerating) the table of contents. Also you are quite sure when 
      you keep your event and its publications in a separate folder locally.</P>
