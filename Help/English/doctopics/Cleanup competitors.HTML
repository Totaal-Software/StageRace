<P> The <span class="screenquote">Cleanup competitors</span> dialog is available 
  through <span class="help_menu">Cleanup competitors...</span> in the <span class="help_menu">Edit</span> 
  menu.</P>
<P>This dialog will clean up typos, such as superfluous spaces in competitor names, 
  categories, country codes, licenses and UCI codes. It will capitalize competitor 
  names before the first comma (&quot;LAST NAME, first name&quot;). It will copy 
  the first three characters of UCI codes to the competitor country codes. Also 
  similar clean up is done for <em>teams</em> and team captains.</P>
<P>The dialog will let you choose what cleanup options to use:</P>
<ul>
  <li class="li_extensive"><span class="screenquote">Remove repeated spaces</span><br>
    E.g.: &quot; Armstrong&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,Lance &quot; will 
    become &quot; Armstrong ,Lance &quot;</li>
  <li class="li_extensive"><span class="screenquote">Remove leading/trailing spaces</span><br>
    E.g.: &quot; Armstrong ,Lance &quot; will become &quot;Armstrong ,Lance&quot;</li>
  <li class="li_extensive"><span class="screenquote">Cleanup comma's for names 
    (such as &quot;xx ,xx&quot; --&gt; &quot;xx, xx&quot;)</span><br>
    E.g.: &quot;Armstrong ,Lance&quot; will become &quot;Armstrong, Lance&quot;</li>
  <li class="li_extensive"><span class="screenquote">Capitalize personal names 
    before first comma</span><br>
    E.g.: &quot;Armstrong, Lance&quot; will become &quot;ARMSTRONG, Lance&quot;</li>
  <li class="li_extensive"><span class="screenquote">Fill empty country codes 
    with leading digits from UCI code</span><br>
    E.g.: from &quot;USA19710918&quot; the first part &quot;USA&quot; will be 
    used as the country code</li>
</ul>
