   <P>
      The default language of the StageRace program is English. However, when 
      you run StageRace in an environment with Dutch as the basic language, StageRace 
      will adapt to that. 

   <P>

   <P>
      The Windows<SUP>®</SUP> default language can be changed in the <span class="screenquote">Regional 
      Settings</span> in the <span class="screenquote">Control Panel</span>. 

   <P>
      The future implementation of additional languages is being deliberated at 
      the time of writing.
