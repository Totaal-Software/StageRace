      Introduction

   <P>
      Omega<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Electronics is part of the world famous watch manufacturer 
      and is among other things specialized in the development of top-end equipment 
      for sports timing.</P>

   <H4>
      Exporting 
   </H4>

   <P>
      Under the name <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Data Handling</SPAN>, the Scan'O'Vision 
      software works with a number of text files, which consist of competitors 
      information and classifications. Data Handling files can typically be found 
      in the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">\osvcolor\dh</SPAN> folder.</P>

   <P>
      StageRace can generate all <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Data Handling</SPAN> 
      files for an event.</P>

   <P>
      In order to have StageRace generate such output files, the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Export 
      competitors for Omega Scan'O'Vision</SPAN> option in the <SPAN CLASS="help_menu">Tools</SPAN> 
      menu has to be chosen.</P>

   <P>
      To configure the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Data Handling</SPAN> in Scan'O'Vision, 
      please refer to the appropriate documentation. </P>

   <H4>
      File Set-up 
   </H4>

   <P>
      The following files will be generated:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI> <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">LstCat.txt</SPAN>: list of categories </LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">LstConc.txt</SPAN>: 
      list of competitors </LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">LstLong.txt</SPAN>: 
      list of race lengths </LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">LstNat.txt</SPAN>:

   </UL>
