      Team Properties Dialog

   <P>
      The <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Team properties</SPAN> dialog is displayed 
      when you insert or edit a team through the 
      
         teams view. It is also displayed when you insert a team from within 
      the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Competitor properties</SPAN> dialog.</P>

   <P>&nbsp;

   <P>
      This dialog lets you enter all properties of a team, namely:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Code</SPAN>: the unique three-digit identification 
      code;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Name</SPAN>: the full name;</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Manager</SPAN>: 
      the manager's name as it is to be printed on the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Competitors 
      list per team</SPAN>; and</LI><LI><SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Country</SPAN>: 
      the country as it is to be printed on the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Competitors 
      list per team</SPAN>.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      Team codes can be changed at any time, but StageRace will require you to 
      enter a team code that is not already used for any other team.</P>

   <P>
      The only field that is really required is the team code. Other fields are 
      informatively only.</P>
