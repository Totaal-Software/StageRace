      Preparation 
   </H4>

   <P>
      Before you enter the ranking for a stage, and preferably also before the 
      actual finish takes place, you should enter the competitors (i.e. 
      
         sign outs) that didn't start for the stage, although they had the 
      right to do so after finishing the previous stage.</P>

   <P>
      For 
      
         time trials you also need to enter a 
      
         time trial starting order.</P>

   <H4>
      Arrival 
   </H4>

   <P>
      For every stage, you can enter the rankings for:</P>

   <UL>
      <LI>The 
      
         stage arrival;</LI><LI>The intermediate 
      
         bonus sprints;</LI><LI>The sprints for the 
      
         sprint classification; and</LI><LI>The sprints for the 
      
         climbing classification.</LI>
   </UL>

   <P>
      Some races use the same sprints for 
      
         intermediate bonus sprints and the 
      
         sprint classification, in which case you will have to enter the arrival 
      data twice.</P>

   <P>
      For all these rankings the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Arrival</SPAN> dialog is used.</P>

   <H4>
      Corrections 
   </H4>

   <P>
      After the actual ranking, some 
      
         corrections might be necessary, based on jury decisions.</P>
