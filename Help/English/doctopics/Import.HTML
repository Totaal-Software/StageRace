         Through the functions (<SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Import...</SPAN>) in 
         the

   <P>
      Note that when you are not familiar with any of the known file types, or 
      want to import form another type of file altogether, you should choose <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">All 
      files</SPAN> and go from there. The settings that you can make in the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Control import classification</SPAN> dialog 
      are very powerful and will surely help you importing your file. Files for 
      importing should be text based and have a rows/fields structure of presenting 
      the data.</P>

   <P>
      In the <span class="screenquote">Import classification</span> file dialog 
      the most recently imported file's name is already entered in the <span class="screenquote">File 
      name</span> edit box, for faster importing in case the same file is involved.</P>

   <P>
      Depending on 
      
         options that have been chosen, you will see the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote"> 
      
         Confirm classification file import</SPAN> 
      
         dialog after the <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Import classification</SPAN> 
      file dialog is closed and <EM>before</EM> the actual import takes place 
      (whether through the 
      
         <SPAN CLASS="screenquote">Control import classification</SPAN> dialog 
      or directly).</P>

   <P>
      When you import rankings, currently available classification information 
      will be overwritten.</P>

   <P>
         From imported files only the first 64kb at maximum will be read in order 
         to prevent the system from what appears to be a system hang-up when accidentally 
         importing a very large file. This will cause no limitations on the functionality 
         since files of such size are not to be expected.</P>
